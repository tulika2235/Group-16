          Nowadays a lot of harassment cases occur in cabs to a point where
          women feel unsafe when they are travelling alone. Even when they need
          to catch a flight or train late at night or early in morning, they
          need to depend on someone from family or friends. So this cab service
          will introduce women cab drivers so that the women of India feel safe
          while travelling. This service is ‘for the women by the women’. This
          will also help women earn money for their livelihood. There is no cab
          service that is made for only women so, this will be the first cab
          service to do so. Women will feel safe. They can go wherever they want
          to go. In a survey majority of the women told that they want to go out
          at night but they feel unsafe so this will help them. The parents will
          also feel safe that their child is safe in the outside world.
