SHE CABS is actually a startup powered by the Andra Pradesh Balala Hakkula Sangham, a voluntary organization working for the protection of child rights in Hyderabad. She Cabs focuses on the agenda cabs “for her by her”. They conducted the survey in which young women and children have the most vulnerable situation working during late hours. Every company and organization have a different approach to attract the people and customers. Like the concept, advertisement, quality of work and other such things. She Cabs also offers a different concept.

## An approach towards women Empowerment

She Cabs is also a step towards empowering women, protecting them as well as providing employment to large number of women. Many cases have proved that the country or the place we are living are not hat safe for women. So She Cabs came into existence. “She Cabs” has women drivers as the name itself suggests. They drives you in a GPS tracked cab. Each Cab is provided with a button to contact the police. This button acts as an alarm system to contact the nearest Police Station.

## Services Provided:

- 24\*7 cab services
- The drivers are well trained. As well as they know martial arts to combat any situation.
- The prices are also affordable depending upon place and distance.

## Challenges

Convincing women and getting women chauffeurs is the biggest challenge. The real challenge for the owners for She Cabs were to get funds. There was the lack of funds. Even though the demand was high considering the proposals from different companies but there were lack of funds to buy cars.

## Benefits

She Cabs is the transport system for the people by the people. Their cabs are mostly pink in color to symbolize She Cabs. It is a way for empowering women. The number of women come from unprivileged backgrounds. Some also come from different non- profit organizations. They are trained by the company itself under the condition to work for them for a year. As public transportation is mainly a male dominated sector. It is a big initiative b this organization to prove that the women can also drive cabs. The organization is mainly in Hyderabad but we expect it to be famous all over the country. The lack of funds is a big hindrance for its expansion in different states and cities. We hope that they get funds and we get to see pink cabs all over India. We must salute this organization for thinking about women so much.
