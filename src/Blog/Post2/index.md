# Women in Male Dominated Industries
A plurality of women (48%) say they work in places where there are more women than men, while 18% say there are more men than women, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Similarly, 44% of men say their workplace is majority-male, and 19% say women outnumber men. About a third of women (33%) and men (36%) say both genders are about equally represented in their workplace.
Women who work mainly with men are also less likely than other female workers to say their workplace pays the right amount of attention to increasing gender diversity. Only 49% say this, compared with 78% of women who say there is an even gender mix where they work and 71% who work in female-dominated workplaces.
## Challenges
Women working in male-dominated industries face a variety of challenges, including:
-	Societal expectations and beliefs about women’s leadership abilities. 
-	Pervasive stereotypes, such as that of the “caring mother” or office housekeeper. 
-	Higher stress and anxiety compared to women working in other fields. 
-	Lack of mentoring and career development opportunities. 
-	Sexual harassment. 
## Key factors that help women to stay
One of the main findings to emerge from our conversations with the women engineers was the significance of the micro-environment – their immediate surroundings. This might involve, for example, the line manager, the team that a women engineer worked with on a day-to-day basis, the culture that affects the behaviour in that notional space. In turn, interaction with and perception of that micro-environment affected the way that the women thought, felt and acted.
## Opening up Opportunities
It is important that women are offered opportunities to test existing skill levels and build confidence in their own abilities, and in doing so to create the kind of internal visibility necessary to advance their careers.
It was clear from our conversations that perceptions of competence were an issue. This was partly about men lacking confidence in the competence of female employees, but primarily women expressing doubts (invariably unfounded) about their own competence. This lack of confidence in their own abilities may be due to gender based micro-aggression in the workplace, or workplace isolation from important networks, for example. Whatever the reasons, these doubts prevent women from seeking out and seizing opportunities to advance their careers, making them less adept at self-promotion.
## Peer Support
Women valued support from line managers and colleagues creating an inclusive micro-environment. This was particularly relevant in terms of judgement about performance, for example. Everyone makes mistakes at work. How we are treated when we make those mistakes can have a huge impact on employee loyalty, and how the employees feel about the organisation that they work in. Women appreciated support from their immediate work group if something had gone wrong – it engendered a feeling of being valued and cared for. It was also relevant when women encountered threatening or difficult situations.
