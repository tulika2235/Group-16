# Some women cab drivers of India
Public transport services being a male dominated sector where only few women able to step up and take up a job as a cab driver. We salute such women who get out of their comfort zone. They are an inspiration for the society that not only man but a women is also capable to drive cars and can be a cab driver. In most cases women are regarded as bad drivers and not given any respect. This mentality of the narrow minded society should be changed. Irrespective of the cast, creed or religion women should step up and make their own place in this male dominated sector. Some women have been able to do this. These women are:
-	Shanno Begum
Shanno Begum is a single mother. She worked as the cook and caregiver to financially support the kids and their education. She never dreamt about becoming a cab driver. She heard about the Azad foundation which offered six month driving course. It was a risky step for her as she was the single mother and she was not able to earn anything for the first six months. But after six months she knew she will get a regular pay. Therefore she completed her training and became a private chauffeur for an year. The she joined as a first female driver in Sakha a women only cab operator. Most people respect and look up to her.

-	Madhu Varma 
Another woman driver of the of the same company Sakha. She tells her experience about working in the company. She tells that her husband has always been supportive of her being the driver. As he is also a driver so he can relate to it. She tells that the normally contract with the company is for one year but you can extend it as you want. Even nowadays Uber and Ola the big cab companies running in India are also giving vacancies of working under them. But for her money is not the only thing. Sakha gives her a good monthly wage as well as protects them and give them a choice who their passenger should be. For her the choice is important as the male passenger sitting behind you can be good or bad. Therefore for women safety is still the major aspect even if they are working in Sakha or ola/Uber.

## Ola and Uber accepting female drivers
Though now Uber have 30% female drivers and Ola have 18% female drivers. But they still do not have safety measures of the women drivers. Due to which most women are not interested in working in them. Even the company is working on safety of women drivers as well as women passengers. There are many cases where women passengers have complains about getting harassed from male drivers. Therefore it is a serious concern. Many women passengers are not comfortable travelling with male drivers late at night. But till now there is no option for a female passenger to get a female driver. Therefore the services of uber and ola could be better in these areas.
